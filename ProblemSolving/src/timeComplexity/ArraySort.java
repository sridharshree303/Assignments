//Given an array sort the numbers in  decreasing order.
//No of elements in array : 10^4

//It is better to compare the algorithms by number of Iterations
//Compare the Algo1 ( 100 log n) && Algo2 (n/10)
//For n < 13746, (n/10) is better
//For n >= 13746, (100 log n) is the better

//Real World
//IND vs PAK : ~2cr , 20 million
//Google search results : ~ millions
//YouTube most watched video : Baby shark : 10 billion

//It is better to choose pick up a algorithm which works for very large input

//Asymptotic Analysis of Algorithms
//Analysis of algorithms for very large input
//Inside that, the Big_O came into existence

//Contribution of lower terms will decrease when n value increases.
// N log N --- 100N
// here N < 2^100 --> N log N
// 		N > 2^100 --> 100 N
